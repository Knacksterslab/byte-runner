## 🐦 X.com / Twitter Post

### Version 1: Technical Audience
```
I built an endless runner that teaches cybersecurity 🎮🔐

Die to ransomware → learn about backups
Get phished → learn about link analyzers  
Credential stuffing → learn about password managers

8 real security tools
15 real threats
100% free

Play: [YOUR-URL]

Made with @nextjs | Open to feedback!
```

### Version 2: Gaming Audience
```
New game: BYTE RUNNER 🎮

It's like Subway Surfers but you actually learn something useful.

Every death teaches you about real cyber threats (ransomware, phishing, etc.) and the tools to defend against them.

Free to play: [YOUR-URL]

Who can reach level 10? 👀
```

### Version 3: Security Community

Built a gamified way to teach security fundamentals 🔐

Instead of boring slides, people learn by:
- Collecting protection kits (password managers, VPNs, MFA)
- Surviving real threats (phishing, ransomware, evil twin WiFi)

## 🚀 Product Hunt Launch

### Product Name
```
Byte Runner
```

### Tagline (60 characters max)
```
Learn cybersecurity by dying repeatedly
```

### First Comment (Maker Introduction)
```
Hey Product Hunt! 👋

I'm [YOUR NAME], and I built Byte Runner because cybersecurity training is painfully boring.

THE PROBLEM:
Most people ignore security advice until it's too late. Companies spend millions on compliance training that employees click through without learning anything.

THE SOLUTION:
Make it a game. When you get hit by ransomware at level 15 without a backup kit, you WILL learn about the 3-2-1 backup rule. When phishing emails kill you, you'll remember to check links.

WHAT I BUILT:
🎮 Endless runner through cyberspace
🔐 8 real protection kits (password managers, VPNs, MFA, etc.)
🦠 15 realistic threats (with real-world breach examples)
🧠 Quiz system - pass to continue, fail to restart
📱 Mobile-optimized with touch controls
💾 Backup kit acts as extra life!

TECH STACK:
Next.js 14, React, TypeScript, Canvas API

WHO IT'S FOR:
- Individuals who need security basics
- Companies looking for engaging training
- Educators teaching cybersecurity
- Anyone who loves arcade games + learning

WHAT'S NEXT:
Currently gathering feedback to improve:
- What threats/topics are missing?
- Is the difficulty balanced?
- Would you use this for your team?

Free forever. No ads. No data collection (just your high score locally).

Try it and let me know what you think! All feedback is welcome 🙏
```

### Description (260 characters max)
```

## 🎮 Reddit Posts

### r/gamedev

**Title:**
```
I built a game that teaches cybersecurity by letting you die to real threats [WebGL]
```

**Post:**
```
Hey r/gamedev! I spent the last few months building an endless runner with a twist - it actually teaches you something useful.

**The Concept:**
Most security training is boring PowerPoints. But if ransomware kills your level 15 run? You'll remember the lesson about backups forever.

**What I Built:**
- Endless runner through neon cyberspace
- 8 protection kits (real tools: Bitwarden, ProtonVPN, Authy, etc.)
- 15 threat types (all based on real attacks with examples)
- 4 progressive zones (Home Network → Office → Mobile → Cloud)
- Quiz system (pass = continue from checkpoint, fail = restart with 50% kits)
- Full mobile support (touch controls, responsive HUD)

**Tech Stack:**
- Next.js 14 + React + TypeScript
- Canvas API for game rendering (60 FPS)
- Zustand for state management
- Tailwind CSS for UI

**What Went Well:**
- Canvas animations are smooth even on mobile
- Educational content is well-received (real breach examples)
- Collapsible HUD solved mobile screen space issue
- Quiz mechanic adds stakes without being frustrating

**What Was Hard:**
- Balancing game difficulty with educational value
- Making complex security topics simple without dumbing down
- Designing controls that work on both mobile and desktop
- Managing 2400+ line game component (should probably refactor 😅)

**Play Here:** [YOUR-URL]

**Looking for feedback on:**
1. Is the difficulty balanced? (too easy/hard?)
2. Is it actually educational or just fun?
3. What security topics am I missing?
4. Performance issues on your device?
5. Would you show this to non-technical friends/family?

Happy to answer questions about the development process!

### r/cybersecurity

**Title:**
```
Made a game to teach security fundamentals - would love feedback from pros
```

**Post:**
```
Hey r/cybersecurity!

I'm a developer frustrated by how boring most security awareness training is. So I built a game that teaches the fundamentals through consequences.

**What It Teaches:**
- Password security (weak passwords, credential stuffing, password reuse)
- Phishing recognition (with email examples)
- Patch management (zero-days, unpatched vulns)
- Privacy protection (doxing, data harvesting)
- WiFi security (evil twin attacks)
- Multi-factor authentication
- Backup strategies (3-2-1 rule, ransomware defense)
- Social engineering (pretexting, baiting)

**How It Works:**
You're running through cyberspace collecting protection kits. Get hit by a threat without the right kit? Game over + mandatory lesson about that defense.

For example:
- Die to ransomware → Learn about Backblaze and the 3-2-1 rule
- Die to phishing → Learn about VirusTotal and URL analysis
- Die to credential stuffing → Learn about password managers and MFA

**Real-World Examples:**
Every threat includes actual breach citations:
- Colonial Pipeline ransomware (2021)
- LinkedIn password breach (2012)  
- Twitter phone pretexting hack (2020)
- WannaCry unpatched systems (2017)

**Target Audience:**
- Individuals who need security basics
- Small business owners
- Educators/trainers looking for engaging content
- Potentially enterprise security awareness programs

**Play Here:** [YOUR-URL]

**Questions for the Community:**
1. What critical topics am I missing? (I know BEC/CEO fraud is important)
2. Are the tool recommendations appropriate? (Bitwarden, ProtonVPN, Authy, etc.)
3. Would this work as supplemental training for non-technical employees?
4. What would make this enterprise-ready?
5. Any inaccuracies in the content?

Constructive criticism is very welcome. I want this to be actually useful, not just fun.

Thanks! 🙏

### r/webdev

**Title:**
```
Built an educational cybersecurity game with Next.js + Canvas API
```

**Post:**
```
Hey r/webdev!

Just finished a 3-month project: an endless runner that teaches cybersecurity concepts.

**Tech Stack:**
- Next.js 14 (App Router)
- React 18 + TypeScript
- Canvas API for game rendering
- Zustand for state management  
- Tailwind CSS
- Deployed on Vercel

**Interesting Challenges:**

1. **Canvas Performance:**
   - Object pooling for obstacles (50 pre-created objects)
   - Culling for off-screen entities
   - Consistent 60 FPS even with 200+ particles

2. **Mobile Optimization:**
   - Touch controls (drag to move)
   - Collapsible HUD (saves screen space)
   - Responsive everything
   - Prevented pull-to-refresh issues

3. **SSR + Client-Only Game:**
   - Hydration errors with game state
   - Used `isMounted` check to prevent server/client mismatch
   - Loading screen with asset preloading

4. **State Management:**
   - Game loop modifies local state (performance)
   - React state for UI updates (score, level)
   - Zustand with persistence for high scores

**Features:**
- Progressive difficulty (4 zones, 15 threat types)
- Educational content (real breach examples, tool setup guides)
- Quiz system for continued play
- Social sharing integration
- Analytics (GA4 + Sentry)
- PWA-ready

**Play Here:** [YOUR-URL]

**Code/Architecture Questions Welcome!**

Would love feedback on:
- Performance on your device?
- Any obvious optimizations I missed?
- Best practices I violated?
- How would you refactor the 2400-line game component? 😅

**GitHub:** [If you make it open source]

Happy to answer any technical questions!
