# Quick Start Guide - New Byte Runner

## What Changed?

**OLD:** Endless vertical runner (like Temple Run)
**NEW:** Horizontal crossing with boss battles (like Frogger + boss fights)

## How to Play (30 Second Summary)

### Level 1:
1. You start on the LEFT edge (cyan square)
2. Press D or → to move RIGHT
3. Dodge falling obstacles (they get faster as you go right!)
4. Reach RIGHT edge
5. BOSS APPEARS with 3 emails
6. Move your player onto the PHISHING email
7. Dodge boss attacks
8. Learn what made it phishing

### Level 2+:
Same as above BUT you must also collect ⚡ GREEN POWERUPS before reaching the edge!

## Controls

```
W or ↑  = Move Up
S or ↓  = Move Down
A or ←  = Move Left
D or →  = Move Right
```

You can move FREELY in any direction!

## Key Mechanics

### 1. Obstacle Speed Zones
```
LEFT SIDE    →    MIDDLE    →    RIGHT SIDE
(Slow)            (Medium)       (FAST!)
```

Obstacles fall faster the further right you go!

### 2. Boss Trigger
Reach LEFT edge OR RIGHT edge → Boss appears

### 3. Email Selection
During boss: Move your player's cyan square onto an email to select it

### 4. Dodge Phase
After selecting: Boss fires projectiles, dodge them!

## Tips

- **Take your time** on left side (obstacles slow)
- **Sprint through** middle section
- **Plan your path** on right side (obstacles super fast)
- **Memorize powerup locations** early (Level 2+)
- **Read email senders carefully** during boss
- **Look for generic greetings** (red flag!)
- **Check domains** (microsoft-verify.net = fake!)
